What is your response to something new? Excitement?
Wonder? Does your heart pump faster and harder? Do you
feel alive? I get that. I understand that. I am
starting a new adventure, though. And I find myself
afraid. Suddenly, growing up is a lot less appealing.
It's funny how I want a degree of freedom but also
security. I want to wander in a safe, mild
environment. Yet I know I cannot do that forever. I
think we all have a deadline which marks our entrance
into productive society. Mine has been set, more or
less. And if I didn't walk this pathway, I would still
need to find a niche. It seems that every niche has
its own demons.
